# Introduction #

Short guide on compilation


# Details #

You need to get project by:

  * **git clone https://code.google.com/p/qml-google-maps/**


Project **qml-google-maps** contains 2 sub projects - version for **meego** and version for **symbian**. Meego version was tested on N9 Nokia phone, Symbian version was tested for C7 and N8 Nokia phones.

**Caution!** - In version for **symbian** maybe you need replace string **import com.nokia.symbian 1.0** to string **import com.nokia.symbian 1.1** in qml-files depending on version QtSDK.

Then the **qml-google-maps** project will be compiled OK.
